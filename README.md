> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Did you ever need to look at five different apps and websites to know what to do in a day? Or needed a place where you can easily see and organize your entire schedule? The Ultimate Calendar is your only calendar app you need, it will allow for individual specialization to fit each person needs. There are options to create tasks that needed to be done and events that are happening as well as creating ways to schedule hobbies and habits, perfect for those wanting to plan their day to the minute or for those who need to remember specific events.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - The structral layout of the calendar. There will be about two pages(maybe more adding and customizing) one for login and the other for calendar view. 
- **CSS** - The styling aspect of the calendar so it can fit differnet screens. It controls the colors and font of the application(a user can customize this)
- **React** - provides login and register new users, dispaly calendar, creating a task list, adding events, also settings for personalizing themse and fonts. It also switches the view for login to the calendar. 
- **Service** - Endpoints
  - register and login
  - retreve user events
  - add new event tasks
  - update events
  - delte events
  - get and set preferences
  - Third party: using other calendar API(like for holidays also maybe google calendar)
- **DB/Login** - Stores all data such as user data, event data, task data, preference data. ensures each user only sees their own data.
- **WebSocket** - handles event and task updates(such as pushing reminders and updating events if changed from other users)
